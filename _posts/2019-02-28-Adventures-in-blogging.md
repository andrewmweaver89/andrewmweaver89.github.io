# Jekyll

### So you bought a google domain now what?

Well if you have a domain name - you will probably *want* something for it to return. But you probably will not want to shell out actual money to make that happen. Plus your not a god damn web developer. Quick and easy solution - github pages with jekyll.

### How to get up and running...

1. Buy a domain (domains.google - honestly not to bad)
   1. Add github SSL ips 185.199.108.153
                            185.199.109.153
                            185.199.110.153
                            185.199.111.153
       as 'A' records
    2. Add CNAME rec for your www - <user>@github.io[github page]
2. Fork a template (https://drjekyllthemes.github.io/top)
3. Add a CNAME to your master branch with the custom domain listed 
4. PROFIT $$
